## The Effects of Childhood Experiences on Adult Offending: A Data-Driven Research Study

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is analyse the relationship between childhood experiences and adult offending history based on data collected from prisoners at Auckland Men's Prison. The study
use data analytics techniques to explore factors such as childhood abuse, education levels, and their impact on later criminal behavior. The research follows ethical considerations,
including Māori research ethics frameworks, ensuring cultural respect and confidentiality.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify correlations between adverse childhood experiences and adult offending behavior.
- Apply statistical techniques to determine significant factors affecting criminal history.
- Utilize descriptive and inferential statistics to extract meaningful insights.
- Ensure ethical research practices, including cultural respect and Māori data sovereignty principles.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Data Source**: Collected from prisoners at Auckland Men's Prison

- **Format**: Survey responses in structured format.

- **Key Features**:

  - Childhood experiences (abuse, neglect, education access, family environment).
  - Adult criminal history.
  - Demographics (ethnicity and background information).
  - Likert-scale responses on self-perceived impact of childhood experiences.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Data Collection & Management: Microsoft Excel
- Data Analysis: Python (Jupyter Notebook)

- **Libraries**:

  - Data Manipulation: pandas, numpy

  - Statistical Analysis: scipy.stats, statsmodels

  - Data Visualization: matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn

  - Hypothesis Testing: chi2_contingency from scipy.stats

## 📊 Analysis & Methodology

- Levels of Data
- Sampling Strategy: Stratified Random Sampling
- Descriptive Statistics
- Inferential Statistics: Chi-Square Test
  - Hypothesis:
    - H₀ (Null Hypothesis): No significant association between physical abuse and impact on later life.
    - H₁ (Alternative Hypothesis): Childhood physical abuse significantly impacts adult life.
- Chi-Square Test Results:
  - Chi-square statistic: 11.27
  - Degrees of freedom: 4
  - p-value: 0.0237 (less than 0.05 significance level)
  - Conclusion: Reject H₀ → Childhood physical abuse has a statistically significant impact on later life.


## 📌 Ethical Considerations

- Cultural Sensitivity: Māori research ethics including Manaakitanga (respect) and Whakapapa (relationships).
- Confidentiality: Prisoners' identities were anonymized.
- Informed Consent: All participants voluntarily contributed to the survey.

## 🚀 Key Findings

This research paper shows that the highest population in the prison is Māori, which is 52%, Pasifika and European are respectively 17% and 19%, the lowest group is other ethnic groups 
which is only 12%.  In terms of abuse category, physical abuse is the highest which is 77%, the next is alcohol and drug abuse, which is 71%, experienced emotional abuse 69%, domestic 
violence 67%, family members commit crime 62%, neglect 48%, sexual abuse 42%, no supportive adults 35% which is the lowest one. According to the studies, individuals who grew up negative
environment and were physically abused are at high chance of being offending rates (Widom, 2021). Combine this research with existing literature reviews indicates that negative childhood
experience significantly affecting the criminal behaviour for the adults. In another words, individual’s immediate family greatly impacts that individual. Family functions such as family
environment, parent-child relationship and communication are playing important role for the children.
